# STL-Mesh-Cross-Section-Visualizer
Sure, here's an example README file you can use for your Python code:

This Python script reads an STL file and generates a 2D cross-section of the mesh at a given Z plane value.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This script requires the following Python packages to be installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy-stl`

You can install them using the following command:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib numpy-stl
```

### Usage

1. Run the script using the following command:

```
python stl_cross_section.py
```

2. Enter the file path of the STL file when prompted.

3. Enter the Z plane value for the cross-section when prompted. The value should be between the minimum and maximum Z values in the mesh.

4. The script will generate a 2D cross-section of the mesh and display it in a new window.
